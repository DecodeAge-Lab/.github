Welcome to our GitHub organization! At [DecodeAge](https://decodeage.com/), we are committed to studying the vast and complex community of microorganisms that inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract. Our goal is to leverage cutting-edge computational techniques and analytical tools to uncover the biological mechanisms that underpin the relationship between the gut microbiome and human health.

Our team of bioinformaticians and microbiome researchers work closely together to develop and implement innovative algorithms and pipelines for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data. Our work spans a broad range of topics, from basic research into the taxonomy and functions of microbial communities, to the development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools for various gut-related conditions. We collaborate with academic institutions, biotech companies, and healthcare providers to translate our research into practical applications that can improve human health.
